# Add the API
## Settings configuration
In settings.py:
    Add 'rest_framework' to INSTALLED_APPS
    Add settings:
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        # Use Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` permissions,
        # or allow read-only access for unauthenticated users.
        'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
            'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly'
        ]
    }

## Create the serializer for the Amendment model
    In api.serializers.py:

from rest_framework import serializers
from api.models import Amendment

class AmendmentSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Amendment
        fields = ['date', 'text', 'title', 'id']

## View for DRF
    In api.views.py:

from rest_framework import viewsets
from api.serializers import AmendmentSerializer
from api.models import Amendment

class AmendmentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Amendment.objects.all() # we can sort and filter here too
    serializer_class = AmendmentSerializer

## Add the router
In urls.py
from rest_framework import routers
from api import views as api_views

router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'amendments', api_views.AmendmentViewSet, basename="Amendment")

url patterns:
    path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework')),
    path("api/", include(router.urls)),

## Run the server and see the changes
http://localhost:8000/api/


## Create a superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
    admin / password / p@ssw0rd!

## Login on the API site
## Create a second amendment
## Create a third amendment
## Show the amendments on the home page
## Delete an amendment on the CLI
a = Amendment.objects.get(id=3)
a.delete()
## pip install requests
## get the amendments with requests
import requests
r = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/amendments/")
amendments = r.json()
amendments
